- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Trayven13
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a successful Software Engineer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my Bachlors degree in Software Engineering from SNHU while working full time on a large ranch.
-  Iâ€™m looking for a apprenticeship / Jr. Software Engineer position. Through the classes I have taken I have a novice amount of knowlege (hello world, while loop, for loop, if, else if, else statements, simple functions, some class structures) in Java and C++. In class I am currently working on how to create a solid software design document. I am also using codecademy on the side to supplement my college courses. Via Codecademy, I am working on learning Swift in preperation to create a few apps that I would find usable for daily purposes.
- ðŸ“« I can be reached by email at trayven.nixon@yahoo.com
